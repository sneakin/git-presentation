  so easy to start working on a project publicly and contribute
  decentralized

  
Content not files
  echo one > test.txt
  git add test.txt
  echo two > test.txt
  git commit
  git status
    #	modified:   test.txt

  goodbye "sane" revision numbers! hello relative numbers

  1-2 branches
  branch per feature (local or remote?)
  branch for bugs!
  
MERGING!
persisting local changes to externals

  easy production branch
