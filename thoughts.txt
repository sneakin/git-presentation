Why git?
  so easy to start working on a project publicly and contribute
  decentralized

  
Content not files

  goodbye "sane" revision numbers! hello relative numbers

branching
  1-2 branches
  branch per feature (local or remote?)
  branch for bugs!
  
MERGING!
persisting local changes to externals
rebase -i
  
commit --amend
commit -i
cherry picking
  easy production branch
  
submodules
